    "narrative_summary": "Your 205.5 minutes show elite focus density: FQS 98.81% means nearly all productive time was deep work. CSC is 1.01 s/h, well below the 1.5 s/h strain threshold, indicating minimal cognitive fragmentation. No reactivity flags are present; the main opportunity is to refine block architecture (longer, fewer blocks) and protect recovery to sustain this quality.",
    "actionable_prescription": "- Structure your next 3–5 sessions around 2 deep-work blocks of 75–90 minutes each, rather than many short sprints.\n- If a high-load block runs past 45 minutes (with CSC staying low), continue to completion and then take a 10-minute analog break (walk, stretch, pen-and-paper review).\n- Maintain CSC ≈1.0–1.2 s/h by lightly batching communications into two windows (e.g., 11:30 and 16:30); keep Do Not Disturb on outside those windows.\n- Pre-commit before each block: write 1 clear outcome and the next 3 actions on paper; close nonessential tabs/apps to prevent micro-switching.\n- Between blocks, run a 60–90 second reset: stand, 3 slow breaths, eye-distance shift (20–20–20 rule), water.\n- End-of-day: review average block length; aim for longer, fewer blocks tomorrow. Track high-load share aiming ≥65% of productive time."
