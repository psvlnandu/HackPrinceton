    "narrative_summary": "The current cognitive metrics suggest a moderate level of risk due to a combination of low Focus Quality Score (55.80%) and slightly elevated Context Switch Cost (1.05 seconds). These indicators imply a level of distractibility and insufficient focus on deep work activities throughout the logged duration of 523.17 minutes, leading to potential inefficiencies in work output.",
    "actionable_prescription": "To address the observed cognitive metrics, it is recommended to implement structured time-blocking strategies for communication applications to reduce reactivity and increase Focus Quality Score. Additionally, incorporate regular scheduled breaks of 10 minutes away from digital devices to sustain focus. This can help in managing cognitive load effectively and improving deep work periods."
