    "narrative_summary": "Your profile shows elite focus capacity: FQS 99.08% indicates nearly all productive time was deep work, and CSC 1.03 s/hr is well below the 1.5 s/hr strain threshold. Across 205.5 minutes (~3h 26m), you maintained sustained focus with minimal context switching. Primary risk is not reactivity but fatigue from prolonged high-load work without deliberate recovery.",
    "actionable_prescription": "- Optimize depth, not fragmentation: keep deep work blocks in the 75–90 minute range rather than adding more, shorter fragments.\n- Insert analog recovery: after any high-load block exceeding 45 minutes, take a 10-minute non-digital break (walk, stretch, breathwork, paper journaling). This sustains performance while CSC remains low.\n- Cycle limits: do 2–3 such blocks before a longer 30–45 minute off-screen recovery to prevent cognitive overreach.\n- Preserve low CSC: batch communications into 1–2 windows (e.g., mid-day and late-day). Keep notifications off and inboxes closed during deep work.\n- Single-task pre-commit: before each block, write one outcome and the exact tools you will use; keep all other apps closed.\n- Lightweight monitoring: note number of switches per block and minutes of high-load work; keep CSC <1.5 s/hr. If CSC rises or FQS dips, tighten communication time-blocks and shorten block length to 50–60 minutes temporarily."
