    "narrative_summary": "The user's cognitive workload analysis indicates a moderate risk situation. With a Focus Quality Score (FQS) of 52.76%, the user's deep work time is considerably fragmented, suggesting a high likelihood of interruptions and distractions. The Context Switch Cost (CSC) is at 1.05 seconds per hour, which is below the high-strain threshold, but the loss of focus and re-engagement efforts is significant enough to reduce overall productivity. These metrics showcase an environment that is not optimized for prolonged deep work, indicating prevailing reactive behavior patterns.",
    "actionable_prescription": "It is vital to address the low FQS and moderate CSC by minimizing interruptions and improving the quality of deep work sessions. First, implement a structured approach to daily workflows by time-blocking Communication apps, ensuring that they are only accessed during predetermined intervals. This will help consolidate deep work time and reduce reactive tendencies. Additionally, periodically schedule 10-minute analog, non-digital breaks to sustain focus and mentally recharge without digital interference. Continually monitoring and adjusting these practices can progressively enhance cognitive performance and productivity metrics."
