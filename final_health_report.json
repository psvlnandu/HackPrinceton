    "narrative_summary": "Your cognitive load profile is strong: 464.25 minutes logged with an FQS of 94.19% (~437.3 minutes deep work) and CSC of 1.05 s/h. This exceeds the excellent FQS benchmark (>85%) and stays below the CSC strain threshold (1.5 s/h), indicating stable attention, low reactivity, and minimal fragmentation (~27 minutes non-deep work). The main watch-out is cumulative fatigue from sustained high-load work; with >45 minutes of high-load effort and low CSC, you should protect endurance with deliberate off-screen recovery.",
    "actionable_prescription": "- Deep-work architecture: Use 60–90-minute focus blocks.\n- Recovery dosing (Rule 4): After each block, take a scheduled 10-minute analog (non-digital) break (walk, stretch, paper notes). Add one longer 25–30-minute off-screen break after the 2nd or 3rd block to prevent fatigue buildup.\n- Daily cadence: Target 4–5 deep blocks across your ~464-minute day, rather than fragmenting into shorter sessions (Rule 3).\n- Context hygiene: Keep notifications silenced during blocks and batch communication checks to 2–3 windows outside deep work to maintain CSC ~1.0–1.2 s/h.\n- Next-metric targets: Maintain FQS ≥ 90%, CSC ≤ 1.2 s/h, and analog-break adherence ≥ 80% of blocks."
